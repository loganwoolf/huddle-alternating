## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)

### What I learned

- CSS comments are awesome.

- rems are a very nice unit for padding/margins.

- CSS gap is perfect for spacing items, it saves having to add a padding to every item in a container.

- Mobile first workflow. Mobile first workflow. Mobile first workflow.

- Defining colors in variables saves a lot of hassle when they need to change.

### Continued Development

- Should find out how to make absolutely positioned elements responsive when the size of the element changes. Might try viewport units next time.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This pen will take a hex color and convert it into a CSS filter. It was used on the footer logo and is incredibly useful.
